# Econometrics_Projects
Projects completed during MScFE 610 Econometrics Course by WorldQuant.
Master Data containes 3 files sources from Yahoo Finance.

In Project 1, I prepared a detailed report on how Fed's decision to reduce benchmark interest rate by 25bps impacted gold and equity markets outside the USA.
Using Nelson Siegel Svensson model, I fitted a yeild curve with 6 different benchmark yields.
Leveraging Python libraries, I modeled gold and equity ETF prices as ARMA model and generated model parameters.
I also modelled the volatility in both the instruments using variance and GARCH model.
Finally, I generated Pearson correlation between gold and equity ETFs and provided intrepretation of the findings.

In Project 2, I prepared a technical report on how alternative investements(gold and Bitcoin) were impacted by the global pandemic.
I worked on fitting GARCH models for the prices of gold and Bitcoin for all 4 quarters of CY2020.
I considered GARCH-M, I-GARCH, T-GARCH and E-GARCH models to find optimal variances in the prices.
Finally, I worked on stationarity and co-integration aspects of the time series usings various tests(Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test, Johansen test and Engle-Granger test).

In Project-3, I prepared a full report on building trading strategy in COVID-19  pandemic for alternative investments.
